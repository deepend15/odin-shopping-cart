A minimalistic mock shopping cart app, built with React, that allows the user to browse products and add them to their cart (with no checkout functionality).

The purpose of this app is to show basic familiarity with React router, fetching data in React, and React Testing Library. Further testing was not completed due to the complexity of using RTL with React Router.
